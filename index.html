<p>Glennan was the perfect choice to lead the new organization. NASA’s first administrator. Glennan emphasized long-range goals that would yield genuine scientific and technological results. As he told everyone at the time, “Our strategy must be to develop a program on our own terms which is designed to allow us to progress sensibly toward the goal of ultimate leadership in this competition.” Recognizing political realities, Glennan also positioned NASA so that it could serve as the vehicle for competing with the Soviet Union in developing a space race.</p>

<p>Robert R. Gilruth had been NACA engineer since graduating from college in the latter 1930s, and shortly after NASA’s establishment, he became director of the Space Task Group at Langley Research Center. In May 1961, Gilruth’s life changed forever.Gilruth and his staff were the people who made the dreams of spaceflight real. Gilruth spent 10 years directing 25 human spaceflights, from Alan Shepard’s first Mercury flight in May 1961, through the first lunar landing by Apollo 11 in July 1969, to the Apollo 15 mission in July 1971.</p>
